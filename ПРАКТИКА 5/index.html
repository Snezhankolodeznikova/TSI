							<p class="mainText">Stray Kids is a South Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment through the 2017 reality show of the same name. The group is composed of eight members: Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin, and I.N. Originally a nine-piece group, member Woojin left Stray Kids due to undisclosed personal reasons in October 2019. The group released their pre-debut extended play (EP) Mixtape in January 2018 and officially debuted on March 25 with the EP I Am Not.</p>

							<p class="mainText">The history of the creation of the South Korean band began thanks to the record company JYP Entertainment, which launched the reality show Stray Kids on October 17, 2017. At the very beginning, two teams fought for the debut - the girls' 2TEAM, assembled by the efforts of the organizers, and the Male Project Team, consisting of young men and formed by the participants on their own. As a result, the producer liked the latter more, and work with her continued.
							A week later, the guys united under the name "Street Children" and presented their debut single to the audience.
							As a result, during the development of the project, Lee Minho and Felix left the team one by one, but more than 95% of the viewers who closely followed the weekly broadcasts supported the decision to return the departed guys.
							The creators of the show listened to the request, and as a result, all nine members remained in the group. In addition to those mentioned, Bang Chan, Kim Woojin, Seo Changbin, Hwang Hyunjin, Han Jisung, Kim Seungmin, and Yang Jongin were there. But in the fall of 2019, Kim Woojin left the group due to personal circumstances.</p>
